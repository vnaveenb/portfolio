Got it üëç ‚Äî you don‚Äôt just want a **static portfolio site**, but a **dynamic system** where you can manage content (projects, certifications, experiences, etc.) through an **admin console** without editing HTML manually. That means we need to define a proper **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for your portfolio system.

Here‚Äôs a first draft of your **PRD**:

---

# üìÑ Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project Name:** Venkata Naveen Busiraju ‚Äì Dynamic Portfolio Website
**Version:** v1.0
**Owner:** Venkata Naveen Busiraju
**Date:** 22-Sept-2025

---

## 1. Objective

Create a professional **portfolio website** with an integrated **admin console** to manage projects, certifications, and career milestones. The solution should:

* Showcase expertise in **GenAI, Cloud, and Full-Stack Development**.
* Allow **dynamic updates** (new projects, certifications, education, etc.) without modifying HTML/CSS/React code.
* Support **secure admin access** for content management.
* Deploy as a **Docker container** integrated with Cloudflare Tunnel + custom domain (`portfolio.naveenb.net`).

---

## 2. Key Features

### A. **Public Portfolio Website**

* **Landing Page**: Name, title, tagline, contact links.
* **About Section**: Professional summary + photo.
* **Work Experience**: Timeline of roles (Atos, etc.).
* **Projects Section**: Dynamic cards with title, description, tech stack, links (GitHub/demo).
* **Certifications & Education**: List with logos, issuers, dates, and credential links.
* **Skills Section**: Categorized (Programming, Cloud, AI/ML, DevOps, Visualization).
* **Contact Section**: Email, LinkedIn, contact form.
* **Extras**: Dark/light mode toggle, downloadable resume, analytics (optional).

### B. **Admin Console**

* **Authentication**: Secure login (username + password, or Cloudflare Access integration).
* **Dashboard**:

  * Add/Edit/Delete **Projects**
  * Add/Edit/Delete **Certifications**
  * Add/Edit/Delete **Experience**
  * Add/Edit/Delete **Skills**
  * Upload Resume (PDF)
* **UI/UX**:

  * Table/list view of entries with edit/delete buttons.
  * Form-based input for new items (title, description, tags, dates, links, logos).
* **Role Management (Future)**: Support multiple admins.

### C. **Data Management**

* Store portfolio content in a **database** (SQLite/Postgres/MongoDB).
* API endpoints (REST/GraphQL) expose portfolio data to frontend.
* Portfolio website **fetches live data** from API instead of hardcoding.

---

## 3. Tech Stack

### **Frontend (Portfolio Website + Admin UI)**

* **React + TailwindCSS**
* **Next.js** (for SEO, routing, server-side rendering)
* **ShadCN/UI** for admin dashboard components
* **Axios/React Query** for API calls

### **Backend (API + Auth)**

* **Node.js + Express** (REST API)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL (preferred) or SQLite (for lightweight NAS use)
* **Prisma ORM** (for schema + migrations)
* **JWT-based Authentication** or Cloudflare Access for admin

### **Deployment**

* **Docker** (multi-stage build ‚Üí Nginx serve frontend + Node backend)
* **OMV NAS** with Docker Compose
* **Cloudflare Tunnel** for secure HTTPS + Zero Trust

---

## 4. User Stories

### Portfolio Visitors

* As a visitor, I want to view Naveen‚Äôs projects, skills, certifications, and contact info so I can evaluate his expertise.
* As a recruiter, I want to download his resume.
* As a collaborator, I want to contact him via form/email/LinkedIn.

### Admin (Naveen)

* As Naveen, I want to log into a secure console to update portfolio content.
* As Naveen, I want to add new certifications (e.g., AWS DevOps Engineer).
* As Naveen, I want to add new projects with description and tech stack.
* As Naveen, I want to edit or delete outdated content without touching code.

---

## 5. Future Enhancements

* **Blog Section**: Post GenAI/Cloud articles.
* **AI Chatbot**: Portfolio chatbot trained on resume.
* **Image Uploads**: For projects/certifications.
* **Analytics Dashboard**: Track visitor metrics.
* **Multi-language Support**.

---

## 6. Success Criteria

* ‚úÖ Portfolio site accessible via `https://portfolio.naveenb.net`
* ‚úÖ Content updates via admin console reflect instantly on main site.
* ‚úÖ Secure authentication for admin panel.
* ‚úÖ Fully containerized deployment (Docker + Cloudflare).

‚ö° This makes your portfolio **enterprise-grade**: structured backend, dynamic frontend, and secure content management.

üëâ Do you want me to draft a **system architecture diagram** (showing React frontend, Node.js API, DB, Docker, Cloudflare Tunnel) so you can visualize how the portfolio + admin console fit into your NAS setup?
